***************************
INSTALLATION:

1. Untar the source files using tar -xzvf Chi8_v1.tgz. This automatically
creates the directory Chi8_v1 and unzips source files into it.

2. Type 'make' to build the executables.

***************************
REQUIREMENTS:

1. NVIDIA Telsa GPU of compute capability 2.0.

2. NVIDIA CUDA toolkit 4.2 or greater. Chi8 v1.0 was built and tested with 
nvcc release 4.2 V0.2.1221

3. GSL 1.15 library for calculating chi-square p-values.

4. CPU and GPU memory must be at least the GWAS dataset size in bytes.

***************************
THREADS:

We recommend 256 threads when running Chi8.

***************************
USAGE:

Usage: ./Chi8 <input file> <rows> <columns> <# of controls> <# of cases> <Bonferroni cutoff> > <output file>

 <input file>            GWAS dataset with each SNP encoded into 0, 1, and 2 (standard encoding).
 <rows>                  Total number of individuals in the dataset.
 <columns>               Number of SNPs per individual.
 <# of controls>         Number of controls in the GWAS dataset.
 <# of cases>            Number of cases in the GWAS dataset.
 <Bonferroni cutoff>     Bonferroni cutoff p-value
 <CUDA DEVICE>           ID of CUDA DEVICE (starting from 0 through (total GPUS - 1))

For example to determine the significant interacting SNP pairs in example1.txt GWAS 
containing 2000 cases, 2000 controls, and 400000 SNPs on GPU 0 the command would be

./Chi8 example1.txt 4000 400000 2000 2000 0.05 0 > output

***************************
INPUT FILE

The input file is a matrix of SNPs representing subjects as rows and SNPs across the 
columns with the genotypes recoded as a single allele dosage number.

In our current implementation all cases should precede controls in the input file.

The example dataset below has 10 subjects with 10 SNPs each encoded based on additive 
allele frequencies. The first 5 rows are the cases and the next 5 rows are the 
controls in the dataset.

0 0 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 0 1 1 0
1 1 2 0 1 0 0 2 1 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 2 0 2 1 0 2 2 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 2 0 2 0 0 1 2 0
2 2 2 0 1 0 0 2 1 0
0 0 2 0 1 0 0 2 2 0

***************************
OUTPUT:

The output contains the significant SNP pairs from the GWAS dataset.
Please note that the interacting SNP positions in the output are calculated 
based on an index starting at 0.

The output has the following columns

SNP-1        SNP postion of the first interacting SNP
Uni-p-value  Univariate chisquare 2-df p-value for SNP 1      
SNP-2        SNP postion of the second interacting SNP
Uni-p-value  Univariate chisquare 2-df p-value for SNP 2   
Chi-Square   Pairwise chisquare 8-df value of the interacting SNPs   
P-value      Pairwise chisquare 8-df p-value of the interacting SNPs
